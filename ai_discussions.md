**User:**  
I have been a valuable part of the google cloud security community. Recently they have just launched a hacakhton or say a competitions on MCP Server a challenge and now I need help to deleiver something great and rare most likely something that's highly required and needs to be common or is common but not given importance enough for security and would be great for this competition and it needs to be given like a human thought too and thus the following challenge, and also tell me what are the things to know and submit too for the competition:

We're bringing to you another Community challenge and this time it's about Model Context Protocol. MCP is a hot topic in the security world right now. For those just hearing about MCP, it allows AI models to communicate with and leverage the capabilities of diverse security tools.  This helps enhance security workflows by ensuring models are contextually aware across multiple downstream services. With the ability to interact with security data in natural language, security teams can produce insights faster and scale their security operations. If you’re just getting started with the SecOps MCP server, check out our SecOps MCPserver content to learn more.

Ideas  
Automation Master: Show your custom scripts, playbooks, or automated workflows that save time on tasks, incident response, or alert enrichment.  
Visibility Guru: Share unique dashboards or reports that provide deep insights, visualize data, identify trends, or track key metrics.  
Integration Wizard: Demonstrate how your MCP server connects seamlessly with other security tools, threat intelligence, or ticketing systems for a unified ecosystem.  
Efficiency Champion: Tell us how the MCP server has reduced false positives, sped up investigations, or improved overall operational efficiency (a "before and after" can be powerful!)  
Examples and Resources  
See what’s new on our video AI Runbooks for Google Cloud Security MCP Server, where we demonstrate how AI  runbooks can enhance your visibility and automate responses within Google Cloud Security.

Here is how you can use MCP for proactive threat hunting, showcasing how the MCP server integrates with various tools to identify and mitigate threats before they escalate. Take a look at our video demonstrating using MCP Servers with ADK, highlighting how this integration can significantly improve the efficiency of your security operations.

Check out our video on starting to use MCP for Google Cloud Security, which walks you through the initial setup and automation capabilities for your security services in Google Cloud environment.

We're looking for creativity, clarity, and most importantly, how you're making the SecOps MCP server work for you. Don't hold back – even small, clever use cases can make a big impact.

**AI:**  
Here’s a strategic approach for a standout submission to the SecOps MCP Challenge, focusing on something valuable yet often overlooked: **Automated Security Playbook Drift Detection & Remediation**.

[AI's full response with idea, what to know, what to submit, and example submission outline.]

---

**User:**  
so what code to submit then? and what other things to give too?

---

**AI:**  
For a strong submission to the SecOps MCP Challenge, you should provide:

### 1. Code Example  
A sample workflow or automation script that demonstrates your idea.  
For the "Automated Playbook Drift Detection & Remediation" use case, you could submit a Python script or YAML workflow that:

- Fetches the current playbook from MCP  
- Compares it to a baseline in Git  
- Sends an alert (e.g., via Slack or email) if drift is detected  
- Optionally, auto-remediates minor changes

**Example (Python pseudocode):**
```python
import requests
import subprocess

MCP_API_URL = "https://your-mcp-server/api/playbooks"
GIT_BASELINE_PATH = "/path/to/baseline/playbook.yaml"

def fetch_current_playbook():
    resp = requests.get(MCP_API_URL)
    return resp.text

def fetch_baseline_playbook():
    with open(GIT_BASELINE_PATH, "r") as f:
        return f.read()

def compare_playbooks(current, baseline):
    return current != baseline

def send_alert():
    # Example: send a Slack alert or email
    print("Playbook drift detected! Please review.")

def main():
    current = fetch_current_playbook()
    baseline = fetch_baseline_playbook()
    if compare_playbooks(current, baseline):
        send_alert()
        # Optionally: auto-remediate or create a Git PR

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

[AI's full response continues with what else to submit.]

**User:**  
help me in writing the code and also the writeup and what more to give provided that I have to prepare that folder and I'll be workin on that oo.

---

**AI:**  
Absolutely! Here’s a step-by-step plan for your submission folder, including code, writeup, and supporting materials. You can use `/workspaces/EduXPU/GCP_security_comm.txt` for your writeup and create a new Python script for the code.

[AI's full response with folder structure, code, writeup, and checklist.]

**User:**  
Don't give a simple code code but a big one more likely a /human written code or likely variables a human would give and not big variables and detailed explained code not with comments but a large one in size

**User:**  
now what to write ?

---

**AI:**  
You should complete and polish your submission folder for the competition. Here’s what to do next:

[AI's full response with checklist and instructions.]

---

**User:**  
give me the writeup in readme.md format

---

**AI:**  
[README.md format writeup provided.]

---

**User:**  
now the only thing left is that how to create my own required or preferred  mcp server?

---

**AI:**  
To create your own MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for testing or development, you have a few options depending on your needs and the level of realism you want. Here’s a practical approach for a dev environment:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/playbooks', methods=['GET'])
def get_playbook():
    # Return a sample playbook as plain text or JSON
    playbook = """
steps:
  - name: check_login_attempts
    action: query_logs
    params:
      source: auth
      threshold: 5
  - name: notify_team
    action: send_alert
    params:
      channel: security
"""
    return playbook, 200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```
